### Who am I😎
I am a computer science engineering student who likes programming projects, especially if there is personal motivation behind them. 

Nowdays, I am working on python, specially on backend programs. I did projects on SQLAlchemy and Django, including the frontend of this last one. 
I worked with different lenguages too; as C++, C, Java, JavaScript...

In my free time I study React.js as I think that is a framework with very high potential compared to his competitors as Vue or Angular.
Also, I have knowledges about Networks and Cloud-Edge infraestructure. For example, in my SQLalchemy project I used MQTT to do a communication beetwen Edge-Cloud servers.

If you are intested to reach me, you can contact me on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mario-k-57b442200/).
